Working Of dual Axis Solar Tracker (Tentative Heading):
A dual-axis solar tracker is a device designed to optimize the performance of solar panels by continuously adjusting their position to track the movement of the sun in both horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation) directions. By doing so, it ensures that the solar panels maintain an optimal angle relative to the sun throughout the day, maximizing their exposure to sunlight and generating more electricity compared to fixed or single-axis solar installations.

The main components of a dual-axis solar tracker include the solar panels themselves, which convert sunlight into electricity, and the dual-axis tracking system. The tracking system consists of mechanical components like motors, ldr sensors & lcd. The azimuth axis allows the panels to rotate horizontally, following the sun's movement from east to west, while the elevation axis enables the panels to tilt vertically, adjusting the angle of inclination based on the sun's elevation.

The working principle of a dual-axis solar tracker involves precise sun tracking and continuous adjustment. Light sensors are used to determine the sun's position by measuring the intensity of sunlight. This information is fed back to the control system, which calculates the optimal azimuth and elevation angles for the panels. The control system then activates the azimuth and elevation motors to move the panels accordingly, ensuring that they face the sun accurately and remain perpendicular to its rays.

Throughout the day, the dual-axis solar tracker continuously tracks the sun's movement and makes precise adjustments to maintain the optimal orientation of the panels. This allows the panels to capture the maximum amount of sunlight, resulting in increased energy production.LCD displays the calibrated value regarding in how much does the motor is moving. 

Overall, dual-axis solar trackers offer significant advantages in terms of energy production and efficiency. They are particularly beneficial for locations with high energy demand or where space constraints make fixed or single-axis trackers less feasible. By continuously optimizing the orientation of solar panels, dual-axis solar trackers maximize the utilization of sunlight, leading to higher electricity generation and improved return on investment.
